            <p class="paragraphLeft"><strong>I’m Dries</strong> and I’m looking forward to the 3rd of October when I will start as one of the students of the <strong>Java developer class from Switchfully</strong> to become a software engineer at UZ Brussel.<br><br>
              Currently, my partner, I, and 2 cats are living in <strong>Antwerp</strong>, which makes it easy to meet up with friends during the weekends. Occasionally we go out sailing and camping. When the sky clears up I pick up my long-lasting hobby which is stargazing with my old telescope.

            <p>My biggest passion is programming, which quickly became a goal that I wanted to chase professionally. Through <strong>self-study and evening courses</strong> I learned the fundamentals of web development with <em>HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL</em>. Next to this I work and experiment with other languages, tools, and frameworks like <em>React, ThreeJS, Python, C#, Cordova, Bootstrap,</em> and anything else I can get my hands on.</p>

            <p class="paragraphRight"> Learning is not something you do completely on your own because of the experiences you gain from colleagues and mentors. This is why I am looking forward to meeting my classmates/colleagues, mentors, and teachers.</p>
